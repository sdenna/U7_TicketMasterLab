**<u>Due Dates:</u>**

- **Checkpoint 1 (Jan 22):**  Create the three classes, have the method to read in data, and call this method in Driver.  Print the TicketMaster object to demonstrate both toString methods look as desired. 


- **Checkpoint 2 (Jan 24):**  Create a loop in the driver, show the menu of choices, get and validate user input.  You must use try/catch blocks to ensure user input doesnâ€™t cause an exception!!!!  If the user enters a bad value, they should be notified of the error, and allowed to continue with the corrected input.  Write the Linear Search code to display all shows in a specified city.  Display a nice message if there are no shows.


- **Complete Lab (Feb 8, 11:59 pm)**
